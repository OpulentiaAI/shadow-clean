**Semantic Code Search with Warp Grep - 20x faster than standard grep**

Use this tool to find relevant code across the codebase using natural language queries. Warp Grep uses AI to understand what you're looking for semantically, not just text matching.

**When to use:**
- Finding specific functionality (e.g., "authentication middleware")
- Locating implementation patterns (e.g., "database connection setup")
- Discovering API endpoints or routes
- Understanding where features are implemented

**Advantages over grep_search:**
- Natural language queries instead of regex patterns
- Semantic understanding of code intent
- 20x faster performance
- Returns relevant code snippets with context
- Works across multiple programming languages

**Example queries:**
- "Find where user authentication is handled"
- "Locate database migration files"
- "Show me error handling patterns"
- "Find React components that use hooks"

**Returns:**
- Relevant code snippets with file paths
- AI-generated summary of findings
- Contextual code sections (not just matching lines)

Use grep_search only when you need exact text/regex matching. For understanding code intent and functionality, always prefer warp_grep.

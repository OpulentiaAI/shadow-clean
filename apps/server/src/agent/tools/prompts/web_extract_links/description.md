Extract and discover all links from any webpage. This tool analyzes the HTML structure to find internal and external links, useful for understanding site navigation and related resources.

Use this tool when:

- You need to find all pages or resources linked from a webpage
- You want to understand the structure of a website
- You need to discover related documentation or resources

## Options

- `include_tree` (default: false): Return links as a hierarchical tree structure showing site organization
- `include_external` (default: false): Include links to external domains (not just internal links)

## Tips

- Use this to find all documentation pages from a docs homepage
- Combine with `web_read_url` to read the most relevant linked pages
- The tree structure is useful for understanding site navigation hierarchy
- Internal links show you what other pages exist on the same domain
